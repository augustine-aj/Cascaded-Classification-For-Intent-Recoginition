## Introduction
This project implements a two-stage intent recognition system using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). The goal is to classify user queries into two categories: **Symptom Checker** and **Non-Symptom Checker**. The project leverages the Hugging Face Transformers library for model training and evaluation.

## Getting Started
To get a local copy of the project up and running, follow these simple steps.
